# VS Code Mediator
## About
Mediator is a modeling language that helps develop formal model through both
- automata-based, precise and formal semantics
- easy-to-use compositional diagrams

This VS Code extension implements Mediator Language Server to provide basic syntax and semantic features by using the [Langium](https://github.com/langium/langium) tool.

## Features
Current implementation only supports keyword highlighting and basic grammar checking.

Semantic highlight and more features are on the way.
